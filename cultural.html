            <p class="custom-card-text">The Brahmotsavam is held over nine days at the beginning of the Hindu calendar month of Āśvina, paralleling Navaratri. The evening before the first day, the rite of Ankurarpana (the sowing of seeds to signify fertility and abundance) is performed. The main first-day activity is Dwajarohana, the raising of the Garuda flag to signify the beginning of the festival. Religious activities during the festival include daily homas and processions on streets surrounding the temple. The final day commemorates Venkateswara's birth star. The Sudarshana Chakra is bathed in the temple tank with the devotees. The Chakra is then placed on a high platform, and the devotees walk under it and are blessed with its dripping water. The festival ends with Dhvajavarohanam, the lowering of the Garuda flag.

              Dwajarohanam
              A ceremony on the first day, when a flag with a picture of Garuda (the vehicle of Vishnu) is hoisted over the temple.[13] The flag is believed to be a symbolic invitation to the Hindu deities to attend the festival.[13] After the ceremony, the Andhra Pradesh chief minister offers new silk clothes to Venkateswara.[14]
              Garuda Vahanam
              On the evening of the fifth day, Venkateswara and Garuda are carried in a procession and decorated with garlands of flowers.[15] Every year, the Tirupati Venkateswara garland is sent to the Srivilliputtur Andal Temple for the marriage festival of Andal.[16]
              Hanumantha Vahanam
              On the morning of the sixth day morning, Venkateswara and Hanuman are taken out in procession.[17]
              Chakra Snanam
              On the morning of the ninth day, the Malayappa, his two consorts and the Sudarshana Chakra are carried in procession to the Varahaswamy Temple.[18] After the abhishekam and presentation of food offerings, the Sudarshana Chakra and its devotees are bathed in the temple tank.[18]</p>

            <p class="custom-card-text">Tirupati laddu or SriVari laddu[1] is the laddu sweet offered as Naivedhyam to Venkateswara at Tirumala Venkateswara Temple in Tirupati, Tirupati district, Andhra Pradesh, India. The laddu is given as prasadam to devotees after having the darshan in the temple. The laddu prasadam is prepared within the temple kitchen known as 'Potu' by the temple board Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams. Tirupati Laddu received Geographical indication tag which entitles that only Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams can make and sell it.[2][3]

              The practice of offering laddu to Venkateswara at Tirumala Venkateswara Temple started on 2 August 1715.[4][5]Laddu potu is the kitchen where Tirupati laddus are prepared. It lies inside the Sampangi pradakshinam of the temple. The Potu is equipped with three conveyor belts used for carrying ingredients into the potu and finished laddus to the selling counters from Potu.[8] Out of three conveyor belts the first one installed during 2007 can transfer only laddus and the second installed in the year 2010 can transfer both laddus and boondi. The third conveyor belt was installed in 2014 as a backup for the two conveyor belts should they malfunction.[9] In olden days only fire wood was used to cook laddus, which was replaced by LPG in the year 1984.[5]

              Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams prepare an average of 2.8 lakh laddus a day in laddu potu. At present, the potu has the capacity to make 800,000 laddus a day.[5]</p>

            <p class="custom-card-text">The dhoti, also known as mardani, jaiñboh, or panche, is a piece of cloth arranged around the waist and the legs, in resemblance to the shape of trousers.[1][2][3] The dhoti is a lower garment forming part of ethnic wear for men in the Indian subcontinent.[4][5] The dhoti is fashioned out of a rectangular piece of unstitched cloth, usually around 5 ft to 4.5 metres (15 ft) long.


              The dhoti is considered to be the male counterpart of the saari worn by females to religious and secular ceremonies (functions).[6] A pitambar is a yellow silk dhoti worn on auspicious occasions.[7][8] Dhotis must not be confused with "readymade panchakachams"[9] or "dhoti pants", which are a new ready to wear trend, popular among women and typical of children.[10][11][12] Although the terms mundu or veshti are used interchangeably with "dhoti",[13] they are different from the dhoti, which is "looped" or wrapped around the legs, in the form of trousers or pants.[14] The dhoti is better known as panchakacham in South India, which may even be worn while doing dances such as moonwalks, but the skirt-like form of the veshti has its limitations, according to fashionistas.[15] While the saari is still draped by women as daily wear, most Indian men no longer know how to wrap the dhoti,[16] as it has been displaced by "English clothes" of the British, in urban areas or cities such as Bombay (Mumbai).[17]</p>

In this capacity, the vahana is often called the deity's "mount". Upon the partnership between the deity and his vahana is woven much iconography and Hindu theology. Deities are often depicted riding (or simply mounted upon) the vahana. Other times, the vahana is depicted at the deity's side or symbolically represented as a divine attribute. The vahana may be considered an accoutrement[1] of the deity: though the vahana may act independently, they are still functionally emblematic or even syntagmatic of their "rider". The deity may be seen sitting or standing on the vahana. They may be sitting on a small platform, or riding on a saddle or bareback.[2]</p>

            <p class="custom-card-text">Ratha Saptami (Sanskrit: रथसप्तमी, romanized: Rathasaptamī), also rendered Magha Saptami, is a Hindu festival that falls on the seventh day (saptami) in the bright half (Shukla Paksha) of the Hindu month Magha.[4] It is symbolically represented in the form of the sun-god Surya turning his ratha (chariot) drawn by seven horses (representing the seven colours) towards the northern hemisphere, in a north-easternly direction. It also marks the birth of Surya and is hence also celebrated as Surya Jayanti (the sun-god’s birthday).[5]
              On Ratha Saptami, a one-day Brahmotsavam is held in Tirumala.On this day, the murtis of the presiding deity of Malayappa Swamy, along with his divine consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi, are taken to a procession in the processional streets in Tirumala. The images circumambulate the shrine of Venkateshvara on seven different vahanas. Due to this reason, the day of Ratha Saptami is regarded to be a minor brahmotsavam in Tirumala.[10]
              Ratha Saptami is symbolic of the change of season to spring and the start of the harvesting season. For most Indian farmers, it is an auspicious beginning of the New Year. The festival is observed by all Hindus in their houses and in innumerable temples dedicated to Surya, across India</p>
